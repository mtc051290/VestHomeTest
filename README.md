# Vest | Backend Engineer - Take Home Test

API developed with FastAPI, MySQL and authentication tools for a trading application

Miguel JesÃºs Torres CÃ¡rdenas - 
_Digital Systems and Robotics Engineer_ 


For this challenge I have decided to take the many advantages of FastAPI, which is a modern, high-performance web framework, to develop an API service for a virtual trading environment where a user can buy/sell stocks, hold stocks and track portfolio performance.

This project focuses on the processing of customer requests, their response and the acquisition of data from the official Nasdaq API; for now, no payment or collection processes are managed.
## ðŸš€ Challenges
The main challenge in this test was to create the ability to buy and sell large amounts of shares and make the relevant calculations as fast as possible.

Another great challenge was obtaining the Nasdaq endpoints, since since October 2021 the API changed and authentication is required to be able to make requests.

At the beginning, it was planned to create cron jobs to communicate continuously to the Nasdaq API, however the problem was solved in another way and without compromising application resources, it is still recommended to develop this type of systems as microservices

Nasdaq API blocks Heroku requests and unprotected AWS EC2 instances, so the project was uploaded to Heroku in order to show documentation
