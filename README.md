_10-01-2022: Currently testing API in Open Market Hours_

For this challenge I have decided to take the many advantages of FastAPI, which is a modern, high-performance web framework, to develop an API service for a virtual trading environment where a user can buy/sell stocks, hold stocks and track portfolio performance. 

__This project focuses on the processing of customer requests, their response and the acquisition of data from the official Nasdaq API; for now, no payment or collection processes are managed.__
